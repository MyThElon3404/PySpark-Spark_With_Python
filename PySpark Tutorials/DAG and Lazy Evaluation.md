# DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph
### DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Spark/PySpark is a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in the Spark execution model. The DAG is “directed” because the operations are executed in a specific order, and “acyclic” because there are no loops or cycles in the execution plan. This means that each stage depends on the completion of the previous stage, and each task within a stage can run independently of the other.
