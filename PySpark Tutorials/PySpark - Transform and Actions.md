# Transformations and Actions - 
### Common Spark jobs are created using operations in DataFrame API. These operations are either transformations or actions.

## Transformation: A Spark operation that reads a DataFrame, manipulates some of the columns, and returns another DataFrame (eventually).

## Action: A spark operation that either returns a result or writes to the disc.
